License
-------

Though this code is mainly useless or boilerplate, I do not want to hinder the
possible usefulness of my work by not licensing it or using restrictive
licensing terms. Therefore, all content in this directory and its
subdirectories is licensed under a similar license to the FreeBSD license,
which is simple and permissive. See `COPYING` for more details.
