============

This is a \*nixy PowerShell imitation implemented in Python. It is currently not capable of running external programs, but it does come with a number of Pythonic "cmdlets." Simply run powerpython.py and press tab to see what's available. Data structures are serialized using YAML.

Dependencies:

* python-yaml
* pyreadline for Windows
